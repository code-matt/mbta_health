# LateForWork

Boilerplate with Angular2(cli,RC5) frontend with a Rails5(5.0.0) Backend in api_only mode.
Rails serves the index.html and Angular's router takes over after that.

## Installation
Change the project name. I suggest doing find and replace 'LateForWork'

This project is setup for Postgres

```
cd <root dir>
bundle install
rails db:create
rails db:migrate
rails db:seed
cd client
npm install
ng build
rails s
```

Right now you have to run ```ng build``` in the client directory while
the server is still running to see any changes you make. Still trying
to figure out how to bring live reload back.

## "Rails Resolver"
This is my best attempt so far for making Rails's routes.rb talk with angular's
router when people go to URL's directly. Mashed together from a few different sources online.
```
client/src/app/resolver/rails.component.ts
this.router.navigate(['index'])
```
Replace 'index' with whatever component you want to be loaded
for visits to the root address.
